# Wordle in JavaScript ðŸš€
This project is a JavaScript implementation of the popular Wordle game. The game gives the player 6 chances to guess a 5-letter secret word. After each guess, the game will provide feedback on which letters are correct, in the correct position, or absent in the secret word with the wordle color scheme. 

### Features âœ¨

**Guess Words**: Each guess must be a valid 5-letter English word, and you have 6 attempts to guess the correct word. If you guess the word within 6 tries, the game displays a "You won!" message, otherwise, it displays a "You lost!" message with the correct word. 
**Colored Tiles**: After each guess, the letters of the guess highlight in green if they are correct and in the right position, yellow if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, and gray if the letter is not in the word. The on-screen keyboard will also color-code keys accordingly.   
**Keyboard**: The user can guess words for Wordle by either typing on their keyboard or clicking on the on-screen keyboard. The keyboard allows for functionality of the backspace and enter as well.
